# What is guacamole-common-js?

guacamole-common-js is the core JavaScript library used by the Guacamole web
application.

guacamole-common-js provides an efficient HTTP tunnel for transporting
protocol data between JavaScript and the web application, as well as an
implementation of a Guacamole protocol client and abstract synchronized
drawing layers.

## What is this fork for?

This is a fork of [glyptodon/guacamole-client](https://github.com/glyptodon/guacamole-client).
It removes all files not necessary for the usage of the javascript library before being submitted to npm,
so you don't have to download any of the files that aren't required. You can read which files/folders are being omitted in the
`.npmignore` file.

You can install this library via npm:

```
npm install --save guacamole-common-js
```

Previously this fork was available as `padarom-guacamole-common-js`, which has been deprecated
in favor of the new version of the fork which is much easier to maintain thanks to the gulp-buildscript.

## Documentation
Distribution-specific packages are available from the files section of the main
